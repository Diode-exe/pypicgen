# pypicgen

## The easiest way to generate grids of pixels!

The default is 512x512, but feel free to fork and modify as you wish. 

number_gen() generates a 262,144 digit file which the rest of the script then converts into a pixel grid

Feel free to disable number_gen() and use your own array of numbers.

 Generating an array consisting of consecutive numbers from 1-148 generated very cool diagonal bars across the image, I encourage you to try it!
